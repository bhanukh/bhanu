                    <p> Website began in 2018. After years in the web hosting industry, we realized that it was near impossible for the average Jane or Joe
					to create their own website.<br>
					Traditional web hosting services were simply too complicated, time consuming, and expensive to manage.</p>

                    <h3> What We Do</h3>
                   <p> A web designer's main job is to design web pages. There is a lot to consider in the design of websites which may not be immediately apparent when
				   looking at a webpage for the first time.

The aesthetic aspect is an important one and selecting the appropriate colors, font, layout and images creates the whole personality of the website.
 In addition to considering aesthetic aspects, the usability of the website has to be a priority. It is important to create a page that the target market can relate to.

For example, a website aimed at children needs to hold their attention, and might use bright colors and an easy-to-read font, with a lot of images and not too much text.
 This would make it fun, attractive and easy to understand. The layout and structure must be easy to follow, and most pages should not be too many clicks deep into the website in 
 order to keep the information easy to access. Contrarily, a professional website aimed at physicians must convey a different kind of image, but must still be easy to read and the 
 information organized in a format that is easy to access.

The web designer is in control of the entire website and must understand how to create the appropriate image while ensuring the website is easy to use and the information is easy
 to access.</p>
